### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
	# The line below should have a double equals like this == instead of a single equals like this =
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
	# The line below should have a colon : right after the else
    else
      return False
   
	# The line below should have a comma , that goes between card1 and card2	
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
	# The line below should return card1 instead of just card 
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  


def cards_total(self, cards):
	# The line below should show a total of = 0
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
	# The return statement in the final line below shoud be placed outside of the loop
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
